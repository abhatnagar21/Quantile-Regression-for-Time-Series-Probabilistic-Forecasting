**Project Overview: Bike-Sharing Usage Forecasting Using NeuralProphet**
This project aims to forecast daily bike-sharing usage using the NeuralProphet model, which is an extension of Facebook's Prophet model. NeuralProphet is particularly effective for time series forecasting tasks and can capture complex seasonal patterns, holidays, and trends.

**Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
The dataset used in this project (bike_sharing_daily.csv) contains daily records of bike rentals.
The dteday column, representing the date, is converted to a datetime object, which is crucial for time series analysis.

**Data Visualization:**

A line plot of bike rental counts (cnt) over time (ds) is created to visualize the historical trend. 
This helps in understanding the overall pattern, seasonality, and any anomalies in the data.

**Data Preparation for NeuralProphet:**
The data is prepared by selecting the necessary columns (ds for date and y for the target variable, i.e., bike count).
The columns are renamed to match NeuralProphet's expected format.

**Model Initialization and Configuration:**
The NeuralProphet model is initialized with specific settings:
Quantiles: Specified to generate prediction intervals (e.g., 5th, 10th, 50th, 90th, 95th percentiles). This helps in understanding the uncertainty in the predictions.
Yearly Seasonality: Enabled to capture yearly patterns in bike rentals (e.g., higher usage in summer).
Weekly Seasonality: Enabled to capture weekly patterns (e.g., higher usage on weekdays or weekends).
Country Holidays: US holidays are added to the model to account for potential effects of holidays on bike rentals.

**Data Splitting:**

The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
This allows the model to be trained on one portion of the data and validated on another, ensuring it generalizes well to unseen data.

**Model Training:**

The model is trained on the training data (df_train) and validated on the test data (df_test). 
Metrics from the training process are printed to assess model performance.

**Forecasting:**

A future dataframe is created, extending the original data by 365 days to generate future predictions.
The model generates forecasts, including the predicted bike counts and associated prediction intervals.

**Visualization of Forecast:**

The forecast is plotted, showing both the historical data and the predicted future values. 
The plot includes prediction intervals, giving a range of possible outcomes and indicating the uncertainty in the forecast

**Optional Diagnostic Plots:**

Additional plots (components and parameters) are generated to analyze the individual contributions of various model components like seasonality, trends, and holidays. 
These diagnostics help in understanding how the model is making its predictions and where improvements might be necessary.
